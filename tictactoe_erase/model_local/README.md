# Model Card for act

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->


[Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2304.13705) is an imitation-learning method that predicts short action chunks instead of single steps. It learns from teleoperated data and often achieves high success rates.




<!-- A short demo is worth more than any description! Record a GIF/video of the policy
running on your robot, upload it to this repo, and embed it here:

This policy has been trained and pushed to the Hub using [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).

Learn how to train and run it in the [LeRobot act guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/act), or browse the [full documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/index).

## How to Get Started with the Model

New to LeRobot? These guides cover the full workflow:

- **[Install LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/installation)** — set up the `lerobot` package.
- **[Hardware setup](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/hardware_guide)** — assemble, wire, and calibrate your robot and cameras.
- **[Record data & train a policy](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/il_robots)** — the end-to-end imitation-learning walkthrough.
- **[CLI cheat-sheet](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/cheat-sheet)** — quick reference for the `lerobot-*` commands.

The short version to run and train this policy:

### Run the policy on your robot

```bash
lerobot-rollout \
  --strategy.type=base \
  --robot.type=so_follower \
  --robot.port=<your_robot_port> \
  --robot.cameras="{ <camera_1>: {type: opencv, index_or_path: <index_or_path>, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}, <camera_2>: {type: opencv, index_or_path: <index_or_path>, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}}" \
  --policy.path=DQwalk/act_so101_pick_place_2cam_300000 \
  --task="Pick up the blue block and put it in the green square" \
  --duration=60
```

Replace the remaining `<...>` placeholders with your own values: `--robot.port` and the camera names/indices are specific to your machine, and the camera names must match the observation keys this policy was trained on.

When `--strategy.type=base` is used the script doesn't record the episodes. Skipping duration will make the policy run indefinitely. For more information look at [rollout documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/inference).

### Train your own policy

```bash
lerobot-train \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/<dataset> \
  --policy.type=act \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/<policy_repo_id> \
  --job_name=lerobot_training \
  --policy.device=cuda \
  --policy.repo_id=${HF_USER}/<policy_repo_id> \
  --wandb.enable=true
```

_Writes checkpoints to `outputs/train/<policy_repo_id>/checkpoints/`._

## Evaluation

<!-- Report real-robot results here: run the policy several times per task and count the
successes. Delete the "No evaluation results" line and fill in this table instead:

| Task | Trials | Successes | Success rate |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | ------------ |
| pick the lego brick | 10 | 8 | 80% |

Also worth noting: anything that affects difficulty (new object positions, lighting,
distractors, a different robot of the same type, ...).
